/**
 * This class is one representation used to transmit the value in the key / value store from
 * the client to the server. 
 * 
 * This extends ArrayList (like a JSONArray), but we made a class for this (as opposed to just using a
 * ArrayList or a JSONArray) so we can dispatch off it in methods and also more easily instrument it.
 * 
 * One of the ideas here is to make it easy to mess with the implementation of this.
 * The other idea is that we also support Strings AND Numbers in this list at some point.
 * 
 * It originally this was the only representation used. The database stored keys and values where
 * the value was an array. This is no longer the case. A guid is now a full JSON Object where each
 * value can be anything including a nested object.
 * 
 * Some internal fields still use this as their base representation in the database. User fields do not.
 * 
 * See also ValuesMap.
