Here is how to do a local test run of the reconfiguration package with
a noop app (in the sub-package examples.noop) on a single machine.

Start the noop nodes as follows:

$ java -ea -Xms4096M -cp path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.reconfiguration.examples.noop.NoopReconfigurableNode

You can also use dist/GNS.jar from a GNS build to not have to specify
the jar paths as above.

Start the reconfigurable app client as follows:

$ java -ea -Xms4096M -cp path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.reconfiguration.examples.ReconfigurableClient

To test with a clean slate (i.e., without recovery), you need to
remove paxos logs and reconfigurator DB logs as follows:

 $ rm -r paxos_logs/ (or whatever log directory was specified in
DerbyPaxosLogger.DATABASE)

$ rm -r paxos_large_checkpoints/ (or whatever log directory was specified in
DerbyPersistentReconfigurationDB.CHECKPOINT_TRANSFER_DIR)

 $ rm -r reconfiguratorDB (or whatever was specified in
DerbyPersistentReconfiguratorDB.DATABASE)

Implementing a new reconfiguration policy is as follows. The default
reconfiguration policy is implemented in the class
reconfiguration.reconfigurationutils.DemandProfile. Do NOT change this
class to change the policy. To change the policy, 
- create your own implementation of
  reconfiguration.reconfigurationutils.AbstractDemandProfile
- Call ReconfigurationConfig.setDemandProfile(.) with that class.
