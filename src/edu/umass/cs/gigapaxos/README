This README explains the following: 
(1) Testing gigapaxos on a single machine; 
(2) Testing gigapaxos in a distributed setting; 
(3) Writing a simple application using gigapaxos. 

For all of the steps below, you first need to either check out the GNS code from the 
repository and compile it using "ant" in the top-level directory so as to create "GNS.jar"
(in the dist/ subdirectory by default) or otherwise obtain a copy of GNS.jar.

(1) Testing gigapaxos on a single machine

Run the following command: 

$ java -ea -Xms4096M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.testing.TESTPaxosMain -c 2>/tmp/run1

The above command will try to create a sub-directory called 'paxos_logs' from wherever it
is run, so you need to have write permissions in that directory. Running it again without 
the '-c' option will continue from where the first run left off as crash recovery is 
enabled by default. The '-c' option will wipe out pre-existing logs, effectively 
disabling  recovery.

If successful, you should see a sequence of "SUCCESS" messages on the console at the end 
of the test run. The test will dump debug logs in /tmp/run1 so that you can see the 
console output clearly. If the test appears to be stuck with no console output and without
returning control to the command-line prompt, or if it throws exceptions on the console, 
it has likely failed. If the test fails, you can try reducing the request load or the
total number of requests in the conf/gigapaxos/testing.properties config file.

In order to completely remove a pre-existing log database, do 'rm -r paxos_logs/'. 
The '-c' option only clears tables while the command-line 'rm -r paxos_logs' option 
removes the whole database. The latter option is needed if you make code changes that 
change the schema of existing tables because they would conflict with recovery logs.
 
(2) Testing gigapaxos in a distributed setting

A distributed test needs two or more machines to run servers and clients. Each server is 
an <IP,port> socket address, so you can run servers and clients on overlapping physical 
machines;  the single machine test above is a special case of a "distributed" test where 
all server and client IP addresses are the loopback address. The server addresses and 
other gigapaxos parameters need to be specified in a config file called "gigapaxos.properties" 
in the same directory where the servers are being run.  This file should contain entries 
as shown below. Each line should start with the constant string "active." followed by a 
string, e.g., "100", that is the server name. The part following the "=" symbol is a 
host:port value. 

APPLICATION=edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.testing.TESTPaxosApp

active.100=date.cs.umass.edu:2100
active.101=plum.cs.umass.edu:2101
active.102=pear.cs.umass.edu:2102

An example of a gigapaxos.properties file may be found in GNS/gigapaxos.properties, where "GNS"
is the top-level GNS directory.

The clients can run on any machine and do not have to be specified in the config file. The name 
and path of the testing config file used by clients can be specified in a file called 
"testing.properties" in the directory ./conf/gigapaxos/. An example of such a file is in 
GNS/conf/gigapaxos/testing.properties where "GNS" is the top-level GNS directory. You can use
this file to control the load, number of clients, request size, number of paxos groups, etc. 
to test gigapaxos' performance numbers.
 
The servers must be started first in any order and can be started as follows:

[date$] java -ea -Xms4096M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.PaxosServer 100 2>/tmp/log100
[plum$] java -ea -Xms4096M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.PaxosServer 101 2>/tmp/log101
[pear$] java -ea -Xms4096M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.PaxosServer 102 2>/tmp/log102

The client should be started only after at least a majority of the above servers are up
and ready. A server is ready after it has stopped printing console output for more than 
a few seconds. The clients are started as follows:

[fig$] java -ea -Xms1024M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.TESTPaxosClient 

If the test is successful, the console output should print a sequence of "SUCCESS" just as 
in the single machine test and the client should terminate gracefully.

(3) Writing a simple distributed application using gigapaxos

To write a simple "hello world" application using gigapaxos, follow 
edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.examples.noop.NoopPaxosApp as an example. This application is also the 
default value of "APPLICATION" and does not have to be specified in gigapaxos.properties. Run
the servers exactly as in step (2) above.

Use NoopPaxosClient in the same package as NoopPaxosApp as the reference client. This client
just sends a few requests to the server and gets back responses. Run this client as follows:

[fig$] java -ea -Xms1024M -cp /path/to/GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gigapaxos.examples.noop.NoopPaxosClient

An application may also be co-located in the same JVM as the servers and can explicitly 
invoke PaxosManager.propose(.) instead of transmitting the request as above from a client 
to a server across a network. For the co-located case, each application node must first
start PaxosManager and then create the corresponding paxos instances, as exemplified in
TESTPaxosNode.java.

The application itself must be an instance of InterfaceReplicable. See NoopPaxosApp.java for a
simple example that simply echoes back the request. The application can delegate messaging 
of responses back to clients to gigapaxos if it also implements InterfaceClientMessenger
and its requests implement InterfaceClientRequest. Again, see NooPaxosApp for an example.
