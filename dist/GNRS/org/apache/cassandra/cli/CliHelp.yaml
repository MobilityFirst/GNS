commands:
    - name: NODE_HELP
      help: |
        help <command>;

        Display the general help page with a list of available commands.;
    - name: NODE_CONNECT
      help: |
        connect <hostname>/<port> (<username> '<password>')?;

        Connect to the a Cassandra node on the specified port.

        If a username and password are supplied the login will occur when the
        'use' statement is executed. If the server does not support authentication
        it will silently ignore credentials.

        For information on configuring authentication and authorisation see the
        conf/cassandra.yaml file or the project documentation.

        Required Parameters:
        - hostname: Machine name or IP address of the node to connect to.

        - port: rpc_port to connect to the node on, as defined in
        conf/Cassandra.yaml for the node. The default port is 9160.

        Optional Parameters:
        - password: Password for the supplied username.

        - username: Username to authenticate to the node as.

        Examples:
        connect localhost/9160;
        connect localhost/9160 user 'badpasswd';
        connect 127.0.0.1/9160 user 'badpasswd';

      help: |
        use <keyspace>;
        use <keyspace> <username> '<password>';

        Use the specified keyspace.

        If a username and password are supplied they will be used to authorize
        against the keyspace. Otherwise the credentials supplied to the 'connect'
        statement will be used to authorize the user . If the server does not
        support authentication it will silently ignore credentials.

        Required Parameters:
        - keyspace: Name of the keyspace to use. The keyspace must exist.

        Optional Parameters:
        - password: Password for the supplied username.

        describe cluster;

        Describes the snitch, partitioner and schema versions for the currently
        connected cluster.

        NOTE: The cluster should only report one schema version. Multiple versions
        may indicate a failed schema modification, consult the project documentation.

        Examples:
        describe cluster;
    - name: NODE_EXIT
      help: |
        exit;
        quit;

        Exit this utility.

        Examples:
        exit;
        quit;
    - name: NODE_SHOW_CLUSTER_NAME
      help: |
        show cluster name;

        Displays the name of the currently connected cluster.

      help: |
        create keyspace <keyspace>;
        create keyspace <keyspace> with <att1>=<value1>;
        create keyspace <keyspace> with <att1>=<value1> and <att2>=<value2> ...;

        Create a keyspace with the specified attributes.

        Required Parameters:
        - keyspace: Name of the new keyspace, "system" is reserved for
          Cassandra internals. Names may only contain letters, numbers and
          underscores.

        Keyspace Attributes (all are optional):
        - placement_strategy: Class used to determine how replicas
          are distributed among nodes. Defaults to NetworkTopologyStrategy with
          one datacenter defined with a replication factor of 1 ("[datacenter1:1]").

          Supported values are:
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.OldNetworkTopologyStrategy

          SimpleStrategy merely places the first replica at the node whose
          token is closest to the key (as determined by the Partitioner), and
          additional replicas on subsequent nodes along the ring in increasing
          Token order.

          Supports a single strategy option 'replication_factor' that
          specifies the replication factor for the cluster.

          With NetworkTopologyStrategy, for each datacenter, you can specify
          how many replicas you want on a per-keyspace basis. Replicas are
          placed on different racks within each DC, if possible.

          Supports strategy options which specify the replication factor for
          each datacenter. The replication factor for the entire cluster is the
          sum of all per datacenter values. Note that the datacenter names
          must match those used in conf/cassandra-topology.properties.

          OldNetworkToplogyStrategy [formerly RackAwareStrategy]
          places one replica in each of two datacenters, and the third on a
          different rack in in the first.  Additional datacenters are not
          guaranteed to get a replica.  Additional replicas after three are
          placed in ring order after the third without regard to rack or
          datacenter.

          Supports a single strategy option 'replication_factor' that
          specifies the replication factor for the cluster.

        - strategy_options: Optional additional options for placement_strategy.
          Options have the form [{key:value}], see the information on each
          strategy and the examples.

        Examples:
        create keyspace Keyspace2
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'
            and strategy_options = [{replication_factor:4}];
        create keyspace Keyspace3
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy'
            and strategy_options=[{DC1:2, DC2:2}];
        create keyspace Keyspace4
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.OldNetworkTopologyStrategy'
            and strategy_options = [{replication_factor:1}];
    - name: NODE_UPDATE_KEYSPACE
      help: |
        update keyspace <keyspace>;
        update keyspace <keyspace> with <att1>=<value1>;
        update keyspace <keyspace> with <att1>=<value1> and <att2>=<value2> ...;

        Update a keyspace with the specified attributes.

        Note: updating some keyspace properties may require additional maintenance
        actions. Consult project documentation for more details.

        Required Parameters:
        - keyspace: Name of the keyspace to update.

        Keyspace Attributes (all are optional):
        - placement_strategy: Class used to determine how replicas
          are distributed among nodes. Defaults to NetworkTopologyStrategy with
          one datacenter defined with a replication factor of 1 ("[datacenter1:1]").

          Supported values are:
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy
            - org.apache.Cassandra.locator.OldNetworkTopologyStrategy

          SimpleStrategy merely places the first replica at the node whose
          token is closest to the key (as determined by the Partitioner), and
          additional replicas on subsequent nodes along the ring in increasing
          Token order.

          Supports a single strategy option 'replication_factor' that
          specifies the replication factor for the cluster.

          With NetworkTopologyStrategy, for each datacenter, you can specify
          how many replicas you want on a per-keyspace basis. Replicas are
          placed on different racks within each DC, if possible.

          Supports strategy options which specify the replication factor for
          each datacenter. The replication factor for the entire cluster is the
          sum of all per datacenter values. Note that the datacenter names
          must match those used in conf/cassandra-topology.properties.

          OldNetworkToplogyStrategy [formerly RackAwareStrategy]
          places one replica in each of two datacenters, and the third on a
          different rack in in the first.  Additional datacenters are not
          guaranteed to get a replica.  Additional replicas after three are
          placed in ring order after the third without regard to rack or
          datacenter.

          Supports a single strategy option 'replication_factor' that
          specifies the replication factor for the cluster.

        - strategy_options: Optional additional options for placement_strategy.
          Options have the form [{key:value}], see the information on each
          strategy and the examples.

        Examples:
        update keyspace Keyspace2
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'
            and strategy_options = [{replication_factor:4}];
        update keyspace Keyspace3
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy'
            and strategy_options=[{DC1:2, DC2:2}];
        update keyspace Keyspace4
            with placement_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.locator.OldNetworkTopologyStrategy'
            and strategy_options = [{replication_factor:1}];
    - name: NODE_ADD_COLUMN_FAMILY
      help: |
        create column family <name>;
        create column family <name> with <att1>=<value1>;
        create column family <name> with <att1>=<value1> and <att2>=<value2>...;

        Create a column family in the current keyspace with the specified
        attributes.

        Required Parameters:
        - name: Name of the new column family. Names may only contain letters,
          numbers and underscores.

        column family Attributes (all are optional):
        - column_metadata: Defines the validation and indexes for known columns in
          this column family.

          Columns not listed in the column_metadata section will use the
          default_validator to validate their values.

          Column Required parameters:
            - name: Binds a validator (and optionally an indexer) to columns
              with this name in any row of the enclosing column family.

            - validator: Validator to use for values for this column.

              Supported values are:
                - AsciiType
                - BytesType
                - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
                - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
                - LexicalUUIDType
                - LongType
                - UTF8Type

              It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class
              that extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

          Column Optional parameters:
            - index_name: Name for the index. Both an index name and
              type must be specified.

            - index_type: The type of index to be created.

              Suported values are:
                - 0: for a KEYS based index

        - column_type: Type of columns this column family holds, valid values are
          Standard and Super. Default is Standard.

        - comment: Human readable column family description.

        - comparator: Validator to use to validate and compare column names in
          this column family. For Standard column families it applies to columns, for
          Super column families applied to  super columns. Also see the subcomparator
          attribute. Default is BytesType, which is a straight forward lexical
          comparison of the bytes in each column.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - default_validation_class: Validator to use for values in columns which are
          not listed in the column_metadata. Default is BytesType which applies
          no validation.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - key_validation_class: Validator to use for keys.
          Default is BytesType which applies no validation.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - gc_grace: Time to wait in seconds before garbage collecting tombstone
          deletion markers. Default value is 864000 or 10 days.

          Set this to a large enough value that you are confident that the deletion
          markers will be propagated to all replicas by the time this many seconds
          has elapsed, even in the face of hardware failures.

          See http://wiki.apache.org/Cassandra/DistributedDeletes

        - keys_cached: Maximum number of keys to cache in memory. Valid values are
          either a double between 0 and 1 (inclusive on both ends) denoting what
          fraction should be cached. Or an absolute number of rows to cache.
          Default value is 200000.

          Each key cache hit saves 1 seek and each row cache hit saves 2 seeks at the
          minimum, sometimes more. The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of
          time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers all the way
          up to 1.0 (all keys cached). The row cache saves even more time, but must
          store the whole values of its rows, so it is extremely space-intensive.
          It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.

        - keys_cache_save_period: Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should
          safe the keys cache. Caches are saved to saved_caches_directory as
          specified in conf/Cassandra.yaml. Default is 14400 or 4 hours.

          Saved caches greatly improve cold-start speeds, and is relatively cheap in
          terms of I/O for the key cache. Row cache saving is much more expensive and
          has limited use.

        - memtable_flush_after: Maximum number of minutes to leave a dirty
          memtable unflushed. This value needs to be large enough that it won't cause
          a flush storm of all your memtables flushing at once because none have
          hit the size or count thresholds yet. For production a larger value such
          as 1440 is recommended. Default is 60.

          NOTE: While any affected column families have unflushed data from a commit
          log segment, that segment cannot be deleted.

        - memtable_operations: Number of operations in millions before the memtable
          is flushed. Default is memtable_throughput / 64 * 0.3

        - memtable_throughput: Maximum size in MB to let a memtable get to before
          it is flushed. Default is to use 1/16 the JVM heap size.

        - read_repair_chance: Probability (0.0-1.0) with which to perform read
          repairs for any read operation. Default is 1.0 to enable read repair.

          Note that disabling read repair entirely means that the dynamic snitch
          will not have any latency information from all the replicas to recognize
          when one is performing worse than usual.

        - rows_cached: Maximum number of rows whose entire contents we
          cache in memory. Valid values are either a double between 0 and 1 (
          inclusive on both ends) denoting what fraction should be cached. Or an
          absolute number of rows to cache. Default value is 0, to disable row
          caching.

          Each key cache hit saves 1 seek and each row cache hit saves 2 seeks at the
          minimum, sometimes more. The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of
          time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers all the way
          up to 1.0 (all keys cached). The row cache saves even more time, but must
          store the whole values of its rows, so it is extremely space-intensive.
          It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.

        - row_cache_save_period: Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should
          safe the row cache. Caches are saved to saved_caches_directory as specified
          in conf/Cassandra.yaml. Default is 0 to disable saving the row cache.

          Saved caches greatly improve cold-start speeds, and is relatively cheap in
          terms of I/O for the key cache. Row cache saving is much more expensive and
          has limited use.

        - subcomparator:  Validator to use to validate and compare sub column names
          in this column family. Only applied to Super column families. Default is
          BytesType, which is a straight forward lexical comparison of the bytes in
          each column.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - max_compaction_threshold: The maximum number of SSTables allowed before a
        minor compaction is forced. Default is 32, setting to 0 disables minor
        compactions.

        Decreasing this will cause minor compactions to start more frequently and
        be less intensive. The min_compaction_threshold and max_compaction_threshold
        boundaries are the number of tables Cassandra attempts to merge together at
        once.

        - min_compaction_threshold: The minimum number of SSTables needed
        to start a minor compaction. Default is 4, setting to 0 disables minor
        compactions.

        Increasing this will cause minor compactions to start less frequently and
        be more intensive. The min_compaction_threshold and max_compaction_threshold
        boundaries are the number of tables Cassandra attempts to merge together at
        once.

        - replicate_on_write: Replicate every counter update from the leader to the
        follower replicas. Accepts the values true and false.

        - row_cache_provider: The provider for the row cache to use for this
        column family. Defaults to ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider.  .

        Supported values are:
            - ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider
            - SerializingCacheProvider

        It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class
        that implements org.apache.cassandra.cache.IRowCacheProvider.

        ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider provides the same features as the versions
        prior to Cassandra v0.8. Row data is cached using the Java JVM heap.

        SerializingCacheProvider serialises the contents of the row and
        stores the data off the JVM Heap. This may reduce the GC pressure.
        NOTE: Thsi provider requires JNA.jar to be in the class path to
        enable native methods.

        Examples:
        create column family Super4
            with column_type = 'Super'
            and comparator = 'AsciiType'
            and rows_cached = 10000;
        create column family Standard3

        column family Attributes (all are optional):
        - column_metadata: Defines the validation and indexes for known columns in
          this column family.

          Columns not listed in the column_metadata section will use the
          default_validator to validate their values.

          Column Required parameters:
            - name: Binds a validator (and optionally an indexer) to columns
              with this name in any row of the enclosing column family.

              type must be specified.

              NOTE: After the update has completed the column family will only
              contain the secondary indexes listed in the update statement. Existing
              indexes will be dropped if they are not present in the update.

            - index_type: The type of index to be created.

              Suported values are:
                - 0: for a KEYS based index

        - comment: Column family description.

        - comparator: Validator to use to validate and compare column names in
          this column family. For Standard column families it applies to columns, for
          Super column families applied to  super columns. Also see the subcomparator
          attribute. Default is BytesType, which is a straight forward lexical
          comparison of the bytes in each column.

            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - default_validation_class: Validator to use for values in columns which are
          not listed in the column_metadata. Default is BytesType which applies
          no validation.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - key_valiation_class: Validator to use for keys.
          Default is BytesType which applies no validation.

          Supported values are:

            - BytesType
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - gc_grace: Time to wait in seconds before garbage collecting tombstone
          deletion markers. Default value is 864000 or 10 days.

          Set this to a large enough value that you are confident that the deletion
          markers will be propagated to all replicas by the time this many seconds
          has elapsed, even in the face of hardware failures.

          See http://wiki.apache.org/Cassandra/DistributedDeletes

        - keys_cached: Maximum number of keys to cache in memory. Valid values are
          either a double between 0 and 1 (inclusive on both ends) denoting what
          fraction should be cached. Or an absolute number of rows to cache.
          Default value is 200000.

          Each key cache hit saves 1 seek and each row cache hit saves 2 seeks at the
          minimum, sometimes more. The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of
          time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers all the way
          up to 1.0 (all keys cached). The row cache saves even more time, but must
          store the whole values of its rows, so it is extremely space-intensive.
          It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.

        - keys_cache_save_period: Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should
          safe the keys cache. Caches are saved to saved_caches_directory as
          specified in conf/Cassandra.yaml. Default is 14400 or 4 hours.

          Saved caches greatly improve cold-start speeds, and is relatively cheap in
          terms of I/O for the key cache. Row cache saving is much more expensive and
          has limited use.

        - memtable_flush_after: Maximum number of minutes to leave a dirty
          memtable unflushed. This value needs to be large enough that it won't cause
          a flush storm of all your memtables flushing at once because none have
          hit the size or count thresholds yet. For production a larger value such
          as 1440 is recommended. Default is 60.

          NOTE: While any affected column families have unflushed data from a commit
          log segment, that segment cannot be deleted.

        - memtable_operations: Number of operations in millions before the memtable
          is flushed. Default is memtable_throughput / 64 * 0.3

        - memtable_throughput: Maximum size in MB to let a memtable get to before
          it is flushed. Default is to use 1/16 the JVM heap size.

        - read_repair_chance: Probability (0.0-1.0) with which to perform read
          repairs for any read operation. Default is 1.0 to enable read repair.

        - rows_cached: Maximum number of rows whose entire contents we
          cache in memory. Valid values are either a double between 0 and 1 (
          inclusive on both ends) denoting what fraction should be cached. Or an
          absolute number of rows to cache. Default value is 0, to disable row
          caching.

          Each key cache hit saves 1 seek and each row cache hit saves 2 seeks at the
          minimum, sometimes more. The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of
          time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers all the way
          up to 1.0 (all keys cached). The row cache saves even more time, but must
          store the whole values of its rows, so it is extremely space-intensive.
          It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.

        - row_cache_save_period: Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should
          safe the row cache. Caches are saved to saved_caches_directory as specified
          in conf/Cassandra.yaml. Default is 0 to disable saving the row cache.

          Saved caches greatly improve cold-start speeds, and is relatively cheap in
          terms of I/O for the key cache. Row cache saving is much more expensive and
          has limited use.

        - subcomparator:  Validator to use to validate and compare sub column names
          in this column family. Only applied to Super column families. Default is
          BytesType, which is a straight forward lexical comparison of the bytes in
          each column.

          Supported values are:
            - AsciiType
            - BytesType
            - CounterColumnType (distributed counter column)
            - IntegerType (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - LexicalUUIDType
            - LongType
            - UTF8Type

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        - max_compaction_threshold: The maximum number of SSTables allowed before a
        minor compaction is forced. Default is 32, setting to 0 disables minor
        compactions.

        Decreasing this will cause minor compactions to start more frequently and
        be less intensive. The min_compaction_threshold and max_compaction_threshold
        boundaries are the number of tables Cassandra attempts to merge together at
        once.

        - min_compaction_threshold: The minimum number of SSTables needed
        to start a minor compaction. Default is 4, setting to 0 disables minor
        compactions.

        Increasing this will cause minor compactions to start less frequently and
        be more intensive. The min_compaction_threshold and max_compaction_threshold
        boundaries are the number of tables Cassandra attempts to merge together at
        once.

        - replicate_on_write: Replicate every counter update from the leader to the
        follower replicas. Accepts the values true and false.

        - row_cache_provider: The provider for the row cache to use for this
        column family. Defaults to ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider.  .

        Supported values are:
            - ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider
            - SerializingCacheProvider

        It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class
        that implements org.apache.cassandra.cache.IRowCacheProvider.

        ConcurrentLinkedHashCacheProvider provides the same features as the versions
        prior to Cassandra v0.8. Row data is cached using the Java JVM heap.

        SerializingCacheProvider serialises the contents of the row and
        stores the data off the JVM Heap. This may reduce the GC pressure.
        NOTE: Thsi provider requires JNA.jar to be in the class path to
        enable native methods.

        Examples:
        update column family Super4
            with column_type = 'Super'
            and comparator = 'AsciiType'
            and rows_cached = 10000;

        subcolumns in the specified super column.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to read from..

        - key: Key for the row to count.

        Optional Parameters:

        list <cf>;
        list <cf>[<startKey>:];
        list <cf>[<startKey>:<endKey>];
        list <cf>[<startKey>:<endKey>] limit <limit>;

        List a range of rows, and all of their columns, in the specified column
        family.

        The order of rows returned is dependant on the Partitioner in use.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to list rows from.

        Optional Parameters:
        - endKey: Key to end the range at. The end key will be included
        in the result. Defaults to an empty byte array.

        - limit: Number of rows to return. Default is 100.

        - startKey: Key start the range from. The start key will be
        included in the result. Defaults to an empty byte array.

        Examples:
        list Standard1;
        list Super1[j:];
        list Standard1[j:k] limit 40;
    - name: NODE_TRUNCATE
      help: |
        truncate <cf>;

        Truncate specified column family.

        Note: All nodes in the cluster must be up to truncate command to execute.

        A snapshot of the data is created, which is deleted asyncronously during a
        'graveyard' compaction.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to truncate.

        Examples:
        truncate Standard1;
    - name: NODE_ASSUME

        assume <cf> comparator as <type>;
        assume <cf> sub_comparator as <type>;
        assume <cf> validator as <type>;
        assume <cf> keys as <type>;

        Assume one of the attributes (comparator, sub_comparator, validator or keys)
        of the given column family match specified type. The specified type will
        be used when displaying data returned from the column family.

        This statement does not change the column family definition stored in
        Cassandra. It only affects the cli and how it will transform values
        to be sent to and interprets results from Cassandra.

        If results from Cassandra do not validate according to the assumptions an
        error is displayed in the cli.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to make the assumption about.

        - type: Validator type to use when processing values.

          Supported values are:
            - ascii
            - bytes
            - counterColumn (distributed counter column)
            - integer (a generic variable-length integer type)
            - lexicalUUID
            - long
            - utf8

          It is also valid to specify the fully-qualified class name to a class that
          extends org.apache.Cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.

        Examples:
        assume Standard1 comparator as lexicaluuid;
        assume Standard1 keys as ascii;

        incr <cf>['<key>']['<col>'] [by <value>];
        incr <cf>['<key>']['<super>']['<col>'] [by <value>];

        Increment the specified counter column by the supplied value.

        Note: Counter columns must be defined using a 'create column family' or
        'update column family' statement in the column_metadata as using the
        ColumnCounterType validator.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to increment the column in.

        - col: Name of the counter column to increment.

        - key: Key for the row to increment the counter in.

        Optional Parameters:
        - super: Name of the super column that contains the counter column.

        - value: Signed integer value to increment the column by. If not supplied
        1 is used.

        Examples:
        incr Counter1[ascii('testkey')][ascii('test col')];
        incr SuperCounter1[ascii('testkey')][ascii('my super')][ascii('test col')] by 42;
        incr Counter1[ascii('testkey')][ascii('test col')] by -4;

        decr <cf>['<key>']['<col>'] [by <value>];
        decr <cf>['<key>']['<super>']['<col>'] [by <value>];

        Decrement the specified column by the supplied value.

        Note: Counter columns must be defined using a 'create column family' or
        'update column family' statement in the column_metadata as using the
        ColumnCounterType validator.

        Required Parameters:
        - cf: Name of the column family to decrement the column in.

        - col: Name of the counter column to increment.

        - key: Key for the row to decrement the counter in.

        Optional Parameters:
        - super: Name of the super column that contains the counter column.

        - value: Signed integer value to decrement the column by. If not supplied
        1 is used.

        Examples:
        decr Counter1[ascii('testkey')][ascii('test col')];
        decr SuperCounter1[ascii('testkey')][ascii('my super')][ascii('test col')] by 42;

    - name: NODE_CONSISTENCY_LEVEL
      help: |
        consistencylevel as <level>

        Sets the consistency level for the client to use. Defaults to One.

        Required Parameters:
        - level: Consistency level the client should use. Value is case
          insensitive.

          Supported values are:
            - ONE
            - TWO
            - THREE
