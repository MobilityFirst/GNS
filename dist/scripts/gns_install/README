Usage
=====

Step 1: Check the available list of commands 
----------------------------------------------

$ fab  -l

Available commands:

    install_gns
    install_java
    install_mongo
    phost


The above is the sample output for which displays a list of commands to be run with fabric. 

Step 2: To Install mongodb/java/gns
------------------------------------

$ fab --config=config phost install_{mongo,java,gns}:/path/to/install


The phost parameter populates the host mentioned in the hosts.txt file (sample file in repo). 
(install_mongo / install_java / install_gns ) will perform the necessary operations on
the hosts present in the host.txt file.

Sample Command
---------------

$ fab --config=config phost install_mongo

The above command will install mongo in default home directory of user which is mentioned 
in the config file. For example, if the user is set to umass_nameservice, then  the above 
command will install mongodb in /home/umass_nameservice .


$ fab --config=config phost install_mongo:/home/umass_nameservice/test/

The above command will 	install mongo in /home/umass_nameservice/test directory instead of home directory of user.

Mongodb / Java will not installed if its is already present in those hosts.


Note
=====

1. Fabric by default uses default username and pvt keyfiles of the local machine unless
   specifically mentioned in the config file.

2. The program assumes all the remote machines have bash shell installed in them. 

3. Currently the java download links are from oracle website, which needs Cookie parameter 
to be setup while remotely downloading it. The <cookie> parameter is setup in install.sh script	. Please contact the author if the java download is from a non-oracle site.
