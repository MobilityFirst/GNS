Quick start:

1. Check out scripts folder: 

svn co svn+ssh://none.cs.umass.edu/svn/mobility-first/GNS/trunk/gns_scripts GNS_SCRIPT

Assuming you have checked out scripts folder at folder GNS_SCRIPT

2. open file GNS_SCRIPT/src/local/exp_config.py

set 'gnrs_jar' to the location of GNS_JAR file
set 'working_dir' to the folder where experiment output will be stored


3. ensure mongodb is running on default port 27017


4. run experiment as follows:

cd GNS_SCRIPT/src/local/
./run_all_local.py


following outputs are generated in 'working_dir' folder:

local/log_local_stats : contains final output generated by parsing the GNS logs

local/log_local : contains raw GNS logs output by local name servers and name servers

local/paxoslog : contains paxos logs that GNS generates

local/trace : contains trace of lookup and update requests sent

local/local_config : config file used by GNS to store list of nodes, their port number, etc.
