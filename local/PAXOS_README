Readme for running paxos:

To run paxos replicas:

(1) Update paths of files in run_paxos.py: jar_file_path, experiment_folder, nodeConfig, testConfig

(2) nodeConfig: Format of each line: <nodeID>  <IP-address> <port>

NodeIDs must be from 0 to N-1. N is total number of nodes.

NodeIDs from 0 to (N-2) belong to paxos replicas. NodeID = N-1 is the nodeID of client, 


(3) testConfig: parameters related to paxos testing. Description of parameters is written below:

NumberOfReplicas: number of paxos replicas.

NumberOfRequests: number of requests sent by client

TestDurationSeconds: duration (in seconds) over which client sends requests

EnableLogging: either true/false. If true, then detailed logs are printed by paxos replicas, else, only paxos decisions are printed by replicas.


(4) run file run_paxos.py as follows to run paxos replicas and a client. Client terminates a few seconds after TestDurationSeconds. 

./run_paxos.py

Logs are output in folder log/
