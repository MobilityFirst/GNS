The installation scripts works like this
============================================

pscp -h host.txt -l <username> <filename> <gns.jar>  <path in that host>
pssh -h host.txt -l <username> "sh <absolute filename to be executed>"


For Example:
-------------
pscp -h host.txt -l umass_nameservice cassandra_inctimeout_config.jar /home/umass_nameservice/rahul/

pssh -h host.txt -l umass_nameservice "java -jar /home/umass_nameservice/rahul/cassandra_inctimeout_config.jar"


Note
-----
1. pscp/ssh can fail if the keys are not added in the ssh path. To add the desired keys in your path.

$ ssh-add <filename>
