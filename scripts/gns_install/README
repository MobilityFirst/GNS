Pre-requisites
==============
1. host.txt file with list of hostnames (sample file in the repository)
2. Fabric Package Module in Python
http://www.fabfile.org/installing.html


Usage
======


Check the available commands provided by program
-------------------------------------------------

$ fab  -l
Available commands:

    install_gns
    install_java
    install_mongo
    phost

The installation has following options. 

$ fab --user=umass_nameservice -i /path/pvt_keyfile phost 
<install_{mongo,java,gns}>:/path/to/install

(to install mongodb/java/gns)

Sample Command
---------------
$fab --user='umass_nameservice' -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pl phost install_mongo

The above command will install mongo in defaul home directory of user.
In this case /home/umass_nameservice


$fab --user='umass_nameservice' -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pl phost install_mongo:/home/test/

The above command will install mongo in /home/test directory instead of home directory of user.


The phost parameter populates the host mentioned in the host.txt file. 
(install_mongo / install_java / install_gns ) will perform the necessary operations on
the hosts present in the host.txt file.

Mongodb / Java will not installed if its is already present in those hosts.


Note
-----
1. To add keys to ssh config 
	$ ssh-add <key_filename> 

2. Currently, the download link for jdk and mongodb are embedded in setup.sh this can be easily changed as a parameter to fabfile.py 

3. While installing GNS.jar . the jar file is expected to be in  the same directory.
