GNS Installer
=============

The Gns Installer, allows user to install the following 

1. Java 
2. MongoDB 
3. GNS.jar

in any of the hosts, which is specified in the hosts.txt file. 

The Python Program  contains the following files 

1. fabfile.py 
2. config
3. install.sh 

As a user of gns installer, you only need to modify the config file with the
following parameters 

user (username)
key_filename (key private filename)
mongo_download (link 'http://downloads.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-i686-2.6.1.tgz')
java_download (link  'http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/7u55-b13/jdk-7u55-linux-i586.tar.gz')
install_path (where to install in the remote machines /desired/install/path)


Pre-requisites
==============
1. hosts.txt file with list of hostnames (sample file in the repository)

2. Fabric Package Module in Python
http://www.fabfile.org/installing.html


Usage
=====

Step 1: Check the available list of commands 
----------------------------------------------

$ fab  -l

Available commands:

    install_gns
    install_java
    install_mongo
    phost


The above is the sample output for which displays a list of commands to be run with fabric. 



Step 2: To Install mongodb/java/gns
------------------------------------

$ fab phost install_{mongo,java,gns}:/path/to/install


The phost parameter populates the host mentioned in the hosts.txt file (sample file in repo). 
(install_mongo / install_java / install_gns ) will perform the necessary operations on
the hosts present in the host.txt file.

Sample Command
---------------

$ fab phost install_mongo

The above command will install mongo in default home directory of user which is mentioned 
in the config file. For example, if the user is set to umass_nameservice, then  the above 
command will install mongodb in /home/umass_nameservice .


$ fab phost install_mongo:/home/umass_nameservice/test/

The above command will 	install mongo in /home/umass_nameservice/test directory instead of home directory of user.

Mongodb / Java will not installed if its is already present in those hosts.


Note
=====

1. To add keys to ssh config 
	$ ssh-add <key_filename> 

2. Currently, the download link for jdk and mongodb are embedded in setup.sh this can be easily changed as a parameter to fabfile.py 

3. While installing GNS.jar . the jar file is expected to be in  the same directory.
