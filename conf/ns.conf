# This is a sample GNS config file for a local name server.
# you can a GNS local name server as follows:
# java -cp GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gns.main.StartlNameServer -configFile gns-ns.conf
# 
# if you want to override an option using command line, do it as follows:
# e.g. use id = 7
# java -cp GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gns.main.StartNameServer -configFile gns-ns.conf -id 7
#
# if a parameter has boolean value, then do it as follows:
# if you want to set parameter to true, then omit the value 'true' from command line
# e.g. to set 'location' to true.
# java -cp GNS.jar edu.umass.cs.gns.main.StartNameServer -configFile gns-ns.conf -id 7  -location
# 
# if you want to set parameter to false, then it is not possible to do it using command line
# you will have to set it in config file.
