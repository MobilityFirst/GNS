# This is the configuration file used by the ACS server.
# Any changes must be approved and tested before they are committed.
# Don't change anything in here unless you know what you're doing.

# One place where this file is different from the standard config file
# is that the port numbers listed below are non-standard.
# This is because the CASA Alerts application is using the clear port.

# Some parameters are needed to maintain backward comptibility with the application.

# The list of property names and values that can be specified here
