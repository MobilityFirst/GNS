 Paxos module can be tested by running this java file: NewClient.java.

     The current test sends a given  number of requests from a client to one of the paxos replicas.

     All paxos replicas agree on the ordering of the request and return the same request back to client.

     At the end, the test outputs the number of requests sent, number of responses received, and the average latency of requests.

     The test requires a config file, a sample config file is located at resources/testCodeResources/testConfig.

     The sample file explains the parameters you can vary in running the test.
